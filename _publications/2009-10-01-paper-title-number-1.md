## Abstract
We have developed a globally applicable diagnostic COVID-19 model by augmenting the classical SIR epidemiological model with a neural network module. Our model does not rely upon previous epidemics like SARS/MERS and all parameters are optimized via machine learning algorithms used on publicly available COVID-19 data. The model decomposes the contributions to the infection time series to analyze and compare the role of quarantine control policies used in highly affected regions of Europe, North America.
