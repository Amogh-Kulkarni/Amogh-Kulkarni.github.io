## Abstract
Scientific studies over last two decades have established that employing protuberances on aerofoils significantly alter the flow field. Use of leading edge tubercles on aerofoils can influence fundamental aerodynamic behaviour like stall. Tubercles can produce similar effects as that of vortex generators. Available research has focussed on fundamental studies. However application of leading edge tubercles for aeronautic propellers in not yet well established. Some research has shown improved propeller performance through numerical simulation. As a part of this study a small two blade propeller is modelled with Leading Edge Tubercles and performance is analysed computationally.
