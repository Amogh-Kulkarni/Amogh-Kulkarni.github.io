## Abstract

Serrations are a new concept conceptualized from owl's wing, which has been utilized to enhance performance. It is capable of enhancing lift without increasing drag. Similarly, the concept of tubercles has been taken from Flippers of Humpback Whales and experiments in the wind tunnel have shown that the presence of tubercles causes an increase in total lift and delay in stall angles without a significant increase in drag. While the more orthodox airfoils with straight leading edges and trailing edge generate flow fields that tend to have limitations on Lift, Drag, and Stall, these leading-edge tubercles and Serrations have opened up a new field for experiments in fluid dynamics and aerodynamics applications. This paper aims to undertake a study of variation in aerodynamic parameters, mainly lift drag and stall characteristics of an asymmetrical, cambered wing incorporated with Serrations at Trailing Edge and the effect of serrations on asymmetrical wing with Leading Edge Tubercles using Computational Fluid Dynamics Simulation.
