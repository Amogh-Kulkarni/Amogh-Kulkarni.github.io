## Abstract

The elliptical spanwise lift distribution is widely regarded as being the most aerodynamically efficient for any planform. Other recent studies contradict this wisdom and rely upon a 1933 paper by Prandtl, stating that the preferred loading is a “Bell-Shaped” span distribution especially where there are wing-bending-moment and span constraints. We conducted configuration design studies considering aerodynamic effects in an incompressible, inviscid flow to investigate the influence of wing twist geometric parameters on normal, axial force and induced drag. Six configurations with high and low Aspect Ratio were designed using a Vortex-Lattice code. We can propose physically feasible planform configurations for some of these loading targets. We verified three of these designs using volume grid CFD to find that the classical elliptical span load remains the ideal distribution to minimize induced drag in the absence of any root-bending-moment constraints. We also determined that “Bell-Shaped” lift distributions are associated with relatively poor span efficiency factors.
