Designed 6 concept wings for elliptical and select non-elliptical lift distribution using potential flow code, VORLAX 
VBA tool point. ****elaborate
Developed database of solution iterations and analyzed select VORLAX wings, in Ansys Fluent CFD within an HPC environment to understand span load, lift, drag and leading-edge suction as a function of angle-of-attack.
